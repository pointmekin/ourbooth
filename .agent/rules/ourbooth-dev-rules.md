This project uses bun for package management and running.

Always use shadcn/ui components as the main component library. You can install missing components with Bun.

Use shadcn/ui components over custom components when possible, avoid overriding the styles of the component unnecessary.

Use Zod for form validation. Create valiation schemas and properly put them in the folder structure according to the best practice.
